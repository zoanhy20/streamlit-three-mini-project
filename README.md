### Description:

This project applies word correction, a key aspect of natural language processing (NLP). It aims to develop applications that suggest the correct version of potentially misspelled words. Using the Levenshtein distance, which measures the minimum number of edits needed to transform one word into another, the project enhances text input accuracy by correcting misspellings.
