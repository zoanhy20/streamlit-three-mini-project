### 2. Description:

This project focuses on the application of word correction, a fundamental component of natural language processing (NLP). The goal is to develop applications that take a potentially misspelled word and suggest the correct version.

### 3. Details:

Word correction is an essential tool in NLP, aimed at improving text input accuracy by correcting misspelled words. For instance, if a user inputs the word "hel", the model will suggest "hello" as the correct word. To simplify this process, the project utilizes the Levenshtein distance, which measures the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions, or substitutions) required to change one word into another.
